## About Me..

I have a bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Engineering and am working as a game client programmer.   
I worked as a programmer for more than three years, launched many games,  
and am also interested in indie games, so I participated in a game jam and won an award.  
  
I am planning to participate in BIC.  

The genres I mainly participated in were 2D and 3D games such as MMORPGs and platformers.  
In the future, my goal is to participate in games that have survival, crafting, and open world elements.  

    Currently, my Emily (M12) team and I are planning to exhibit a game called "MeMiMic" at BIC.
